== ReadMe Project
This is a test of using AsciiDoc for creating readme files in our projects.

Preparation
-----------

[NOTE]
====
A sample note admonition.
We can add notes and other admonitions to the document that use gemoji icons. The section at the top of the document assigns the icons. Look at the lines that begin `tip-caption`, `note-caption`, etc.
====

TIP: It works!

IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor is awesome, don't forget!

CAUTION: Don't forget to add the `...-caption` document attributes in the header of the document on GitHub.

WARNING: You have no reason not to use Asciidoctor.
